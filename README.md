# Robot control panel

## What does this repository contain:
I designed a web page to control the robot’s movement in four directions: right-left-forward-backward and stop moving. <br> 
After that, an abbreviation letter for each direction is saved in the database, such as [Forward], its abbreviation is “F” and so on,<br>
and the reason is that in the event of an accident The robot malfunctions or stops , We can find out the last movement made by the robot from the database.

## Web page:
